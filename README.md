# MQTT-JS
Simple clientside Javascript MQTT transceiver using the Paho library.
Works with all the basic functions you would expect. Multiple subscribed topics, credentials, client ID etc.
Unlike some other browser based MQTT transceivers this one can function, without the need of software running on a server.
